*server-the-first is a living project. I don't have or want a social media presence, and this seems like a neat way for me to express myself while also keeping my thoughts more organized. In my head, this also has an audience, so I will try to make it fun. #followmeongithub

*expect to see errors in code/thoughts/grammar/spelling - i am very new to this world and I juggle a lot of things.

*feel free to comment/bug report/push/pull or whatever else github can do if you want to contribute to this knowledge base.
