# introduction

tldr - I am using github as a personal knowledge base as I wind my way through the process of becoming truly tech literate at the ripe old age of 42. These notes will be filled with spelling errors and grammatical mistakes because the represent my thoughts in the moment. I will take care to keep things as fresh as possible and continue updating my notes as I go.


<h1>about-me</h1>

I have a fairly interesting background, almost none of it is in technology. I have experience in restaurants, hotels, corporations, tech companies (bus dev), and currently I own a few escape rooms, an axe bar, and a small kitchen with my wife.

<h1>how-this-all-started</h1>

I have a friend who works in IT as some sort of systems administrator. He is responsible for some pretty complicated environments and he is very good at his job. He is entirely self taught. I have always known enough about computing to have intelligent conversations with him, but I never really understood what he did. The more we talked about his homelab the more interested I got in setting up my own. He built up a rig on pcpartpicker for me and I built my first server [[locke-lamora]]. The same friend also gifted me [[calo-and-galdo]] so I have two servers at home

The original intention of this project was to be able to have a simple media server, a few virtual machines, and maybe some simple services. The more I learned about the services that are available in the open source community, the more and more I added to the server's workload. I immedeately saw the value for a server at my business, so [[father-chains]] was built to manage that.

From there the rest is history.

<h1>what is serverthefirst</h1>

Twelve months ago I did not know how to wire a relay. I did not know how to code an arduino, I did not know how to *use* a computer. I loved in the digital world as many of us do: unaware of the constant eye of cloud services. My job requires a low level understanding of a lot of disciplines in order to do it well. There are many axe bars and escape rooms that get by doing less (read: nothing at all) but I have really high aspirations and I would like to build a system that easily helps me move from project to project.

The hardest part of this project for me is that there has been no roadmap. That is the precise goal of this project - to provide new users with a roadmap that will help them build one server from beginning to end with mimimal downtime and troubleshooting. There are guides and videos and websites that all help you install individual applications but they are all designed for more advanced users who are installing those apps on their own, unique server.

The serverthefirst project will take new users who have very little understanding of computing through the process of building an entire unRAID server. Every app review, every dummy sheet, every port, and every setting in any of the guides will work on the stf template server.
