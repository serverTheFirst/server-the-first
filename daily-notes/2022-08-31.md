# 2022-08-31

Technologically speaking, not much happened today. I couldn't work on this repo because i couldn't figure out how to get vs code to sync with github.  was getting merge errors so I just decided to merge it all and see what happened. If there is stuff missing, I will just redo it.

Tomorrow morning I will get more folders/files created. If I can make just a little progress every day, this thing will come together pretty nicely. It looks like shit now, but it'll slowly start to take it's own shape.
