# why-even-bother


This is one I struggle with myself lol. This is a huge challenge. The learning curve is high and this is not a simple concept. Part of it is the personal pride I have when I have made something. This project isn't my first heavy lift and it's also not the only heavy lift I am managing.

Part of it not knowing what the future holds as far as our digital identities in the changing world. Between the motivations of the large corporations and the government, very little trust exists in the digital world. Recently as of this writing, facebook provided law enforcement with chat logs between mother and daughter that will be used to prosecute an abortion case. That scares me.

I can empathize, to at least some degree, with the mindset of the disaster prepper. While there is no limit to the number of crazy conspiracies that seem to be the news source of so many, we have actual evidence of corporate and governmental malfesance when it comes to data protection. Police 'accidentally' losing body cam footage and facebook/alphabet profiting off your every internet activity. It is easy to want to try to protect yourself against that- after all, aren't your thoughts your own?

I used to be the person who didn't care about privacy because I 'hAd noTHiNg tO HiDe', but in reality I knew nothing. I still barely know more than nothing. I have been at it, at the time of this writing, for maybe two months here and there.
