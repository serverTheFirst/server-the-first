# hardware-considerations

<small> remember that your first server does not need to be on anything expensive. New users looking to setup thier serverthefirst server will be able to do it with any computer made in the last decade. It may not be fast at all of it, but it will certainly get you started. You don't need to put money into something that doesnt need money put into it. My parents bought me my first car for $700 in 1997 and told me I was responsible for all maintenance costs and that it <i>also</i> needed a $700 clutch. What I am getting at is - if you are poor or have little money to spend, go online and find a $100 computer to get you started. It needs an ethernet port and room for a couple or more hard drives.

also - don't build a pc only based off my ramblings here. go to pcpartpicker.com and watch a bunch of videos.</small> 

<h1>server hardware:</h1>

<b>motherboard:</b> this is the main board for a computer. More or less everything else plugs into this and this is the electronic means of keeping it all communicating. Things to ask yourself when assessing a motherboard for your server are quantity of sata ports (for hard drives) The pros among us will all want to add a bunch of granular details about what motherboards do but in reality its the thing you plug your other computer things into\
\
<b>processor:</b> this is the part that does a lot of math and if it fits in the motherboard, you're good to go.\
\
<b>RAM</b> is the thing that everyone tells you to max out and no one uses.16MB is ample. 8 is also fine. rPi also fine.\
\
<b>graphics card: for the purposes of a first server, you probably don't even need a graphics card that is capable of anything special, if you'd need one at all</b>
