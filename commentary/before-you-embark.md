# before-you-embark


before you embark on this journey and buy your first server to setup, here are a few programs/services you will want to get comfortable with:

1 - your browser. you are going to use this a lot. Remember all those articles on how to power use [browser] that you skipped over? Yea, you are going to want to reread those. Know how to customize your browser. You won't know right away how you like it, but knowing the basics of changing settings around ahead of time will save you a lot of time.

2 - vs code. It's intimidating. It's colorful. It's just a fancy notepad. Between this and your browser you have two very powerful tools in your hands if you use them right. Or even at all, really.

3 - email provider. You may want to create a new email for this project, you may not. You will need to understand what smtp and imap settings your email provider allows. Many of the programs you will encounter have email connectivity options that are handy to use.
